Nitros9-Level-3
===============

Source code repository for Nitros9 Level 3

This is not yet fully compilable, but is being documented from Alanâ€™s code modification. As well as bootfiles provided by Bob Devries & Robert Gault. 

The best boot for L3 right now is Robert Gaults. It can be booted in VCC with HD support using EMUDSK.  It does not work with HDB-DOS 1.4 or DW4.

The commenting is taken directly from the Nitros9 repo for what matches to KRN and IOMAN. So anything that is commented is matching to current v3.3.0, other than the differences I found between the 3 boots I have.
