The versions of Clock included here were produced with the help of EddieKuns and his Clock Ed.9 archive.  Without him, these would have never beenpossible.  Many thanks and kudos!If you already have a clock which works fine on your system, I'd recommendthat you too keep it.  These updates are meant solely to 'fill the gap'between the clocks that the NitrOS-9 developers and their customers have had.To install the clock driver replacement, choose the appropriate driver fromthe archive and use it to replace the module "Clock" from your OS9Boot file.Not all versions of all clocks are provided -- if you need a specific versionwhich isn't provided below, contact Northern Xposure, and we will ship itto you. If you have a RTC other than a type mentioned here, let us know andwe'll do our best to add that clock's capability to NitrOS-9.All clocks below are module edition #10, revision 4.  Eddie's Clock Ed.9were revision 3.All support the F$Time and F$STime system calls.  The "setime" command willwork with all of them.  The RTC clocks all read the real-time-clock onceper minute.  While they are doing this, interrupts are disabled.  Somepeople have noticed an occasional lost character while communicated at higherbaud rates using the Clock Ed9 on a stock system.  Hopefully NitrOS-9fixes this problem.The only differences between these versions of clock and the NitrOS-9 v1.22mclock archive is that support for Level III has been added.  Unfortunately,the memory extensions to Level III slow down IRQ servicing somewhat, and19.2k may not be possible.  All I can suggest is to try it and see.                     60 Hertz clocksClock.L3.soft.60Hz           Software clockClock.L3.dsto2.60Hz          Disto 2-in-1 RTC, no MPIClock.L3.dsto2.s4.60Hz       Disto 2-in-1 RTC, MPI slot 4Clock.L3.dsto4.60Hz          Disto 4-in-1 and 3-in-1 RTC, no MPIClock.L3.dsto4.s4.60Hz       Disto 4-in-1 and 3-in-1 RTC, MPI slot 4Clock.L3.BB.s3.60Hz          B&B CoCoXT-RTC, MPI slot 3Clock.L3.BB.s2.60Hz          B&B CoCoXT-RTC, MPI slot 2Clock.L3.elim.60Hz           Eliminator                     50 Hertz clocksClock.L3.soft.50Hz           Software clockClock.L3.dsto2.50Hz          Disto 2-in-1 RTC, no MPIClock.L3.dsto2.s4.50Hz       Disto 2-in-1 RTC, MPI slot 4Clock.L3.dsto4.50Hz          Disto 4-in-1 and 3-in-1 RTC, no MPIClock.L3.dsto4.s4.50Hz       Disto 4-in-1 and 3-in-1 RTC, MPI slot 4Clock.L3.BB.s3.50Hz          B&B CoCoXT-RTC, MPI slot 3Clock.L3.BB.s2.50Hz          B&B CoCoXT-RTC, MPI slot 2Clock.L3.elim.50Hz           Eliminator
